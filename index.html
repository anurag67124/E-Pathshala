            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">As alluded to at the beginning of this section, the discussion of
                whether to use virtual or physical learning environments is unlikely to yield an answer in the current
                format. First, the efficacy of the learning environment may depend on the concept being taught.
                Additionally, comparisons provide differences in learning theories as explanations for the differences
                between virtual and physical environments as a post-mortem explanation. When virtual and physical
                environments were designed so that the same learning theories were employed by the students, (Physical
                Engagement, Cognitive Load, Embodied Encoding, Embodied Schemas, and Conceptual Salience), differences
                in post-test performance did not lie between physical vs. virtual, but instead in how the environment
                was designed to support the particular learning theory.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Teacher use of technology</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Computing technology was not created by teachers. There has been little
                consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it. Decisions to
                purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these
                technologies did not grow up with them. Training teachers to use computer technology did improve
                their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style
                of delivery. The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory
                part of the training, by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver
                online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor
                monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues
                raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).

                Newer generation web 2.0 services provide customizable, inexpensive platforms for authoring and
                disseminating multimedia-rich e-learning courses, and do not need specialised information technology
                (IT) support.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big"> Learning theories</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Good pedagogical practice has a theory of learning at its core. However,
                no single best-practice e-learning standard has emerged. This may be unlikely given the range of
                learning and teaching styles, the potential ways technology can be implemented and the ways in which
                educational technology itself is changing. Various pedagogical approaches or learning theories may
                be considered in designing and interacting with e-learning programs.

                Social-constructivist – this pedagogy is particularly well afforded by the use of discussion forums,
                blogs, wiki and online collaborative activities. It is a collaborative approach that opens educational
                content creation to a wider group including the students themselves. The One Laptop Per Child Foundation
                attempted to use a constructivist approach in its project.

                Laurillard's conversational model is also particularly relevant to e-learning, and Gilly Salmon's
                Five-Stage Model is a pedagogical approach to the use of discussion boards.

                Cognitive perspective focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning as well as how the brain
                works.
